## SET BUILD TO x86 OTHERWISE GLFW WILL NOT LINK AND BUILD WILL FAIL***

A recreation of popular videogame "Minecraft" built entirely in C++, OpenGL, and GLSL. I'm aiming to learn more about how GPU's work at a low level, and improve my C++ skills. This is my major side project currently, and it's far from finished. Feel free to clone the repo and test the code for yourself.

If you find any issues, or want to add a new feature, just enter an issue or pull request! ðŸ™‚ I'm more than happy to keep this project open source. 

Currently working on fixing OpenGL context issues to get cubes to render textures, and also get the main 3D camera working.

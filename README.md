# Minecraft Clone
<b>***Set Visual Studio Solution to x86 build***</b><br>
A recreation of popular videogame "Minecraft". I'm aiming to learn more about how GPU's work at a low level, and improve my C++ skills. This is a side project currently, and it's far from finished. Feel free to clone the repo and test the code for yourself.

I used GLFW, GLAD, and OpenGL to write this. I learned about vertex and index buffers, textures, UV coordinates, reading block metadata from JSON, and the basics of the graphics rendering pipeline. In the future, I plan to add support for more textures, and implement more features, such as creating and deleting blocks, terrain generation, and sound effects. 

If you find any issues, or want to add a new feature, just enter an issue or pull request! ðŸ™‚
